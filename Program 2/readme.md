The game of Sorry is a board game, played with cards, numbered 1-12. The cards are shuffled and
place face-down, so the numbers can’t be seen. The player draws from the deck, one card at a time, and
turns the card face up to reveal the number.

We will implement the game, where we have 2 players, and each player has one pawn that need to
move from the Home point and reach the End point before the other opponent to win the game.

Rules of the Game:
- The first player now must pick a card. Numbers on card are in the range of 1-12.
- 
o Player needs 1 or 2 to start his/her turn:

 If number on card is 1, player’s pawn will stand on the Start point.

 If number on card is 2, player’s pawn will move one extra step (Start, and one
other step)

o Player cannot get out of their Home, until they get 1 or 2.

 If one player did not get 1 or 2 to start his/her game, then it will be the opponent
turn and so on.

o If the number on the card is 4, then the player has two options:

 Move 4 steps.

 Or “Sorry” take the spot of the opponent’s pawn and opponent need to go back
to Home and start all over again.

o Players will take turns, until one player reach the End point first.

 Distance from the Start point to the End point is 30 steps.
